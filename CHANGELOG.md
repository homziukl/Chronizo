# Chronizo OET Changelog

## v3.10 — Delete/Create Lock Hotfix

- Added defensive repair after event deletion, bulk deletion, loading, merging, startup, and refresh.
- Cleans stale UI state after deleted events:
  - stale selected IDs,
  - stale edit-panel event ID,
  - stale connect source,
  - dead connections pointing to deleted events,
  - empty bulk-edit dialog state.
- Release-order media blocks are now treated as view-only synthetic blocks and cannot be bulk-selected/deleted as if they were real events.
- All module cache-busting query strings updated to `v=3.10`.

## v3.9 — Release Grouping Fix

- Release Order groups by release date + universe + media label.
- Micro-event `type` values such as event/clue/background no longer split one episode into multiple release blocks.
